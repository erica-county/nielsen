# Introduction to Open Source Tools

This repository contains the materials for a short course at Nielsen introducing some important open source tools.  Specifically, we will cover basic UNIX, git, SQL, and Python useage.  We expect little or no previous experience with computing and any of these tools/languages.

 ### Installations

 - **Week 1**: 

This week, you will need a terminal that executes `bash` commands and is connected to your larger file system.  On a macintosh or linux machine, this is native and no installations are necessary.  **WINDOWS USERS**: Please download and install [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).  During the download you will need to add the application to your PATH:
